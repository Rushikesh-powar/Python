1. Here we will use the tkinter library for building the GUI application.
   This library is inbuilt in python.

2. For this we will require to build the initial window or the 'root window' and this window will terminate
   at the end of the code, anything between these will be displayed to the screen.

3. Then you can directly start to put the widgets(labels, buttons, text fields, etc) into the root frame.
   but the only thing is that you should reference root window to every item, otherwise it will not be
   displayed. Then you should 'pack' that item onto the frame.

4. The only precaution is that when you start by default the window is not resized(if root).

5. So to over come you can use the 'Canvas', which can be predefined by some initial height and width.
   so when the window is started it is not too small.

6. The next thing you can add to the GUI window is 'Frame', which is resizable and can have user defined
   colors, as well as dimensions. You can also reference your widgets to this 'Frame' and not the root.

7. The widgets can be created just as a new variable. These widgets can be assigned with text,
   background and foreground color, with their position in the frame etc.

8. These widgets can be placed into the frame with functions like pack(), grid(), place().
   The most preferable is place() as it more flexible and resizable according to the user.

9. You can also add background images with 'PhotoImages()' in tkinter and giving its path in the function.

10. Here an opensource API has been used for displaying the weather of an particular city.
    This API takes the city name from the widget(textbox) and then send it through the request module 
    to the API server and display the weather to the Label(display).
