1. This project i have used the tkinter library for the GUI application by using
   "import tkinter as tk" or " from tkinter import * ".

2. Here grid() has been used for the extra features for the column and row space.

3. The only draw back is that it this grid() placement is not dynamic.

4. Then different function have been called when a button is pressed.
   this is done using the " command= " keyword.

5. Then lambda function is used to insert the digits dynamically.

6. Each operator(+ , - , * , /) has its own function for calculating.

7. to clear the entry(textbox) the " delet() " function, and to add " insert() "
   functions are used.
