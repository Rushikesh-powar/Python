Hello Guy's This is my first (Python)GUI Project.

This project aim's for creating an TextEditor(Ultra Editor) which is capable of
executing python scorce code, And reading files with extensions such as
.txt, .csv, .py, .cpp, .html, etc

The Ultra Editor Comprises of Functionalities and Features like:
. Auto-Indent, Auto-Complete
. Syntax higlighting(currently python specific)
. Source Code Execution(currently python specific) (Shift + F5)
. Code Block Execution(selection + F5)
. Search function(selection + F3)
. Fullfledged Font Menu.
. Editior Themes, Drak, Light.

Current Application has some bugs in Number line, Auto-Indente.
If you wish to improve these bugs please contact at my email or can also contribute with code fix for these bugs.
Also open for suggestions.
